[h1] Calamity Stealth Strikes only [/h1]
Have you ever found yourself having too low of a focus to use Calamity's rogue stealth strikes?
Well this is the mod for you!

This mod forces the player to only be able to use rogue weapons if the player has enough stealth to perform a stealth strike.
You will NOT be able to attack if you do not have full stealth (or 75% with Coin of Deceit and 50% with its upgrades)

A configuration option exists that disables the check for Coin of Deceit, causing you to require full stealth at all times.
