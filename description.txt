Have you ever found yourself having too low of a focus to use Calamity's rogue stealth strikes?
Well this is the mod for you!

This mod forces the player to only be able to use rogue weapons if the player has enough stealth to perform a stealth strike.
Also has a config to ignore the Coin of Deceit and its upgrades for if you want to only use stealth strikes at 100% stealth.
There's also a hotkey (you have to bind it yourself like all other modded keys) that lets you enable/disable the stealth lock on the fly.
